# Supported Versions Policy

For Ruby, we support the versions [listed as being under normal maintenance](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).

For Ruby on Rails, we support the versions [listed as supported for bug fixes](https://rubyonrails.org/maintenance).

This means that new features may not be available to older versions, but we still try to ensure that the Ruby LSP is stable.

We will consider contributions to support other versions of these tools, as long as they not detrimental to the project's overall health.
