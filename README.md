# Ruby LSP

The Ruby LSP is an implementation of the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
for Ruby, used to improve rich features in editors. It is a part of a wider goal to provide a state-of-the-art
experience to Ruby developers using modern standards for cross-editor features, documentation and debugging.

Want to discuss Ruby developer experience? Consider joining the public
[Ruby DX Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ruby-dx/shared_invite/zt-2c8zjlir6-uUDJl8oIwcen_FS_aA~b6Q).
