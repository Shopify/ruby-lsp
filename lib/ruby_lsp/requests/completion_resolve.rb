    #
    # The [completionItem/resolve](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#completionItem_resolve)
    # request provides additional information about the currently selected completion. Specifically, the `labelDetails`
    # and `documentation` fields are provided, which are omitted from the completion items returned by
    # `textDocument/completion`.
    #
    # The `labelDetails` field lists the files where the completion item is defined, and the `documentation` field
    # includes any available documentation for those definitions.
    #
    # At most 10 definitions are included, to ensure low latency during request processing and rendering the completion
    # item.
    #
    # # Example
    #
    # ```ruby
    # A # -> as the user cycles through completion items, the documentation will be resolved and displayed
    # ```
    class CompletionResolve < Request
      extend T::Sig
      include Requests::Support::Common

      # set a limit on the number of documentation entries returned, to avoid rendering performance issues
      # https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/pull/1798
      MAX_DOCUMENTATION_ENTRIES = 10

        # Based on the spec https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_completion,
        # a completion resolve request must always return the original completion item without modifying ANY fields
        # other than label details and documentation. If we modify anything, the completion behaviour might be broken.
        #
        # For example, forgetting to return the `insertText` included in the original item will make the editor use the
        # `label` for the text edit instead
